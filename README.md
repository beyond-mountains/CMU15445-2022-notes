# CMU15445-2022-notes

As a classic database course, CMU15445 is a rare and excellent educational resource, and the after-school project is a magical journey.

After months of hard work, we have finally completed the 2022 course project. And summarized the four projects.

Thank you to the pioneers. Thank you to Andy and TAs for their contributions to the course.

Thank you fellow travelers. The blog summary and sharing of all the big shots have helped me find direction in confusion.

Thank you to those who came later. Let's keep moving forward in solving problems.
